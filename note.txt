Define Relationships Between Tables
C1. Multimap return types
@Query(
    "SELECT * FROM student" +
    "JOIN course ON student.id = course.student_id"
)
fun loadStudentsWithEnrolledCourses(): Map<Student, List<Course>>
=> lot of complex SQL queries

C2: Intermediate data class
Idea: create a data class to model the relationship between your Room entities.
